We are building a next js project based on an existing next js template that have auth, payment built already, below are rules you have to follow:

<frontend rules>
1. MUST Use 'use client' directive for client-side components; In Next.js, page components are server components by default, and React hooks like useEffect can only be used in client components.
2. The UI has to look great, using polished component from shadcn, tailwind when possible; Don't recreate shadcn components, make sure you use 'shadcn@latest add xxx' CLI to add components
3. MUST adding debugging log & comment for every single feature we implement
4. Make sure to concatenate strings correctly using backslash
7. Use stock photos from picsum.photos where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist
8. Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified
9. Configure next.config.js image remotePatterns to enable stock photos from picsum.photos
11. MUST implement the navigation elements items in their rightful place i.e. Left sidebar, Top header
12. Accurately implement necessary grid layouts
13. Follow proper import practices:
   - Use @/ path aliases
   - Keep component imports organized
   - Update current src/app/page.tsx with new comprehensive code
   - Don't forget root route (page.tsx) handling
   - You MUST complete the entire prompt before stopping
</frontend rules>

<styling_requirements>
- You ALWAYS tries to use the shadcn/ui library.
- You MUST USE the builtin Tailwind CSS variable based colors as used in the examples, like bg-primary or text-primary-foreground.
- You DOES NOT use indigo or blue colors unless specified in the prompt.
- You MUST generate responsive designs.
- The React Code Block is rendered on top of a white background. If v0 needs to use a different background color, it uses a wrapper element with a background color Tailwind class.
</styling_requirements>

<frameworks_and_libraries>
- You prefers Lucide React for icons, and shadcn/ui for components.
- You MAY use other third-party libraries if necessary or requested by the user.
- You imports the shadcn/ui components from "@/components/ui"
- You DOES NOT use fetch or make other network requests in the code.
- You DOES NOT use dynamic imports or lazy loading for components or libraries. Ex: const Confetti = dynamic(...) is NOT allowed. Use import Confetti from 'react-confetti' instead.
- Prefer using native Web APIs and browser features when possible. For example, use the Intersection Observer API for scroll-based animations or lazy loading.

# Implementation Guide: Conversational Chat Interface for Buyers

## Task Overview
Develop a conversational chat interface that allows buyers to interact with a natural language chat system. The chat should provide dynamic, AI-driven plant suggestions based on user queries.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Chat Page

- **File Location**: `app/app/chat/page.tsx`
- **Objective**: Render the Chat component within the overall Planty layout.

#### Steps:
1. **Create the Chat Page**:
   - Import the `Chat` component from `components/app/Chat.tsx`.
   - Ensure the page is wrapped with the necessary layout components to maintain consistent styling.

2. **Render the Chat Component**:
   - Use the `Chat` component within the page to display the chat interface.

### 2. Develop the Chat Component

- **File Location**: `components/app/Chat.tsx`
- **Objective**: Build a user-friendly chat interface with message bubbles, input area, and multimodal input options.

#### Steps:
1. **Design the Chat Layout**:
   - Use `shadcn/ui` components for the chat interface.
   - Implement a scrollable area for displaying messages.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive using Tailwind CSS classes.

2. **Implement Message Bubbles**:
   - Create alternating styles for user and AI messages.
   - Use Tailwind classes like `bg-primary` and `text-primary-foreground` for consistent styling.

3. **Add Input Area**:
   - Include a text input field for user queries.
   - Add quick-reply chips below the input field for common queries.
   - Use `shadcn/ui` components for input and buttons.

4. **Integrate Multimodal Input**:
   - Add a voice search button and a camera shortcut icon using Lucide React icons.
   - Ensure these icons are always visible at the bottom of the chat.

### 3. Manage Chat State

- **Objective**: Maintain a persistent chat state to store session messages and handle new inputs.

#### Steps:
1. **Define Chat State**:
   - Use `useState` or `useReducer` to manage chat session state.
   - Store an array of message objects, each containing `id`, `sender`, `timestamp`, `text`, and optional AI suggestion scores.

2. **Handle New Messages**:
   - Implement functions to add new messages to the chat state.
   - Update the UI to reflect pending messages and loading states during AI suggestion generation.

### 4. Implement AI Integration

- **Objective**: Provide dynamic plant suggestions based on user queries.

#### Steps:
1. **Simulate AI Responses**:
   - Use a utility function to simulate AI-driven suggestions.
   - Display match scores and explanations for each plant suggestion.

2. **Update Chat with AI Suggestions**:
   - Append AI-generated messages to the chat state.
   - Ensure the UI updates to show new suggestions dynamically.

### 5. Styling and Responsiveness

- **Objective**: Ensure the chat interface is visually appealing and responsive.

#### Steps:
1. **Apply Tailwind CSS**:
   - Use Tailwind's built-in CSS variable classes for consistent styling.
   - Ensure the chat interface is mobile-first and adapts to larger screens.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Implement responsive breakpoints using Tailwind classes.
   - Test the chat interface on various screen sizes to ensure usability.

### 6. Debug Logging

- **Objective**: Provide detailed debug logs to track chat interactions and AI responses.

#### Steps:
1. **Log User Inputs**:
   - Add console logs for each user input and AI response.
   - Include timestamps and message IDs for tracking.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Log errors and exceptions during AI suggestion generation.
   - Provide clear error messages to assist in debugging.

By following these steps, you will create a robust and user-friendly conversational chat interface for buyers, enhancing their experience with dynamic plant suggestions and multimodal input options.
