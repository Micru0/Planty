Below is a proposed feature/task breakdown for Planty. Each task is scoped with a clear user story, describes the expected UI flow and state/data points, and follows the guidelines (starting with the overall layout/UI). Note that every component and styling uses shadcn/ui and Tailwind’s built-in CSS variable classes. The plan is arranged in an order that first builds the foundational UI, then progressively implements key buyer and seller journeys.

────────────────────────────
1. Task: Overall Layout & Core UI Implementation

• User Story:
 “As a user (buyer or seller) visiting Planty, I want to immediately see a clean, responsive, and well-organized application layout so I can easily navigate settings, view conversations, or start listing my plant.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Implement the overall page layout in app/app/page.tsx.  
 – Update the existing Header.tsx (in components/app) to adjust its styling to match Planty’s visual language (e.g., use bg-primary for header background, text-primary-foreground, and appropriate spacing).  
 – Define a consistent navigation scheme (e.g., a top navigation bar for desktop and a bottom navigation or FAB for mobile) using shadcn/ui components.  
 – Ensure the layout is mobile-first with responsive Tailwind CSS classes.  

• UI Details:
 – Header with Planty logo/name, navigation links (e.g., “Chat”, “Listings”, “Cart”)  
 – A main content container that will later render dynamic components for chat, listings, etc.  
 – Responsive breakpoints defined through Tailwind (mobile-first, then expand to larger screens).  

• State & Data Points:
 – Global theme state (if needed, via context)  
 – Navigation state (active link highlighting)

2. Task: Conversational Chat Interface for Buyers

• User Story:
 “As a buyer, I want to interact with a natural language chat interface so that I can ask for advice like ‘Show me pet-safe plants for my balcony’ and receive dynamic, AI-driven suggestions.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Develop a Chat component using shadcn/ui (e.g., message bubbles, text inputs, quick-reply chips) that fits intuitively within the overall layout.  
 – Provide a scrollable conversation area which displays messages paired with match scores and explanations (for each plant suggestion).  
 – Add a voice search button and a camera shortcut icon (using Lucide React) that is always visible at the bottom of the chat for multimodal input.  
 – Integrate a persistent chat state (using useState or useReducer) that stores current session messages.  

• UI Details:
 – Header section (e.g., with the chat title “Planty Chat”)  
 – Message list with alternating styling for user vs. AI messages  
 – Input area with text field, quick-reply chips below, and icons on the side  
 – Use Tailwind variables (e.g., bg-primary, text-primary-foreground) for consistent styling.  

• State & Data Points:
 – chatSessionId, an array of message objects (each with id, sender, timestamp, text, and optional AI suggestion scores)  
 – Pending message state and UI loading state during AI suggestion generation

 “As a seller, I want to quickly upload a plant photo that automatically detects species, care needs, and suggested pricing so that I can create a listing in seconds with a high degree of confidence.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Build a Photo Upload Component using shadcn UI’s file input elements with support for multi-image (if needed).  
 – Integrate a real image recognition library (do not use a placeholder) to simulate AI analysis. Show a loading indicator (using a spinner from shadcn/ui) while processing the image.  
 – Once the image is processed, display detection results including species, care suggestions, and pricing suggestions with confidence ratings. Allow fields to be editable.  
 – Use card-based UI to group the AI suggestions and image preview.

• UI Details:
 – An upload area (drag-and-drop or click-to-select) styled with Tailwind colors  
 – A preview card: image on one side and a panel showing auto-filled data (with icons from Lucide React for each detail such as care, pricing)  
 – Edit controls (inline text inputs or dropdowns) for user corrections  
  
• State & Data Points:
 – Uploaded image file state  
 – AI result object: { species, careNeeds, suggestedPrice, confidence }  
 – Editable form state for any AI-overridden details

4. Task: Seller Listing & Publishing Flow

• User Story:
 “As a seller, after uploading a plant photo, I want to preview my listing with side-by-side comparisons to similar products so I can confirm the details and publish my listing confidently.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Create a multi-step flow:  
  ◦ Step 1: Photo upload with AI detection (from Task 3)  
  ◦ Step 2: Edit and adjust AI-provided details (using a card-based UI with shadcn components)  
  ◦ Step 3: Preview listing with a side-by-side view comparing the new listing with similar market products (a static placeholder list or integrated with another component for suggestions)  
  ◦ Step 4: Publish the listing which updates the backend (Supabase integration for writing to user_listings table).

• UI Details:
 – Wizard-style progress indicator at the top of the flow  
 – Each step uses clear, well-spaced form controls  
 – Use shadcn/ui buttons (styled with bg-primary) for “Next”, “Back”, and “Publish”  
 – Preview page displays: plant image, AI suggestions, editable fields and smart tags

• State & Data Points:
 – Listing data state object: { images, species, price, careDetails, tags }  
 – Preview mode flag and edit mode toggle  
 – Connection to Supabase (via existing utils) for saving listing data

 – Favorite items state (persisted to Supabase via existing utilities)

────────────────────────────
6. Task: Care Calendar Generation Post-Purchase

• User Story:
 “As a buyer who has completed a purchase, I want to see an auto-generated care calendar with personalized reminders so I can care for my new plant easily.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Once the purchase is confirmed (using the checkout flow from Task 5), automatically generate a care calendar.  
 – Create a Care Calendar component that displays the schedule, care tasks, and reminders (e.g., watering, fertilizing).  
 – Utilize a calendar view or list view styled with shadcn/ui components.  
 – Include a “Notification Reminder” test setup (e.g., using browser notifications or in-app alerts).

• UI Details:
 – Calendar or list view with clearly segmented days  
 – Each task displays the care instruction, time, and a “mark as done” checkbox

 – Local state for toggling tasks as completed  
 – Integration with user notifications (stubs may be used initially)

────────────────────────────
7. Task: Implement Dynamic Filters & Product Discovery Enhancements

• User Story:
 “As a buyer, I want to filter plants by parameters (light level, size, watering frequency) and see personalized recommendations based on my past chats and purchase habits so that I can easily find the perfect plant.”

• Scope & Details:
 – Create a Filters Panel component using shadcn/ui elements (checkboxes, sliders, dropdowns).  
 – Integrate filter choices with the product listing view to update displayed results in real time.  
 – Maintain the filter state and user search preferences (persisted to Supabase under search_preferences).  
 – Use a stateful context or useState hook to store current filter selections and update the UI accordingly.

• UI Details:
 – A collapsible side-bar (or a modal on mobile) for filters  
 – Display of active filters, with options to clear all  
 – Incorporate minimal animations (using CSS transitions) for when the filter panel opens/closes

• State & Data Points:
 – Filter state (object: { lightLevel, size, wateringFrequency, ... })  
 – Product list state that gets filtered accordingly  
 – Persisted preferences used to tailor future AI suggestions in chat

────────────────────────────
Additional Considerations

• For all tasks, ensure that the UI components use shadcn/ui (import from '@/components/ui') and Tailwind classes that reference built-in color variables (e.g., bg-primary, text-primary-foreground).
• The mobile-first approach should be baked into each component (using responsive Tailwind classes).
• Although testing and analytics aren’t separate tasks, consider briefly adding state flags or logs (e.g., on AI acceptance vs. edits) to track KPI metrics for future phases.

Following this roadmap will enable the team to iteratively build a fully functional Planty application—from foundational layout through the conversational experience to the end-to-end seller and buyer journeys—while meeting all design and integration requirements.
